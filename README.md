# Maillon
Extends WordPress with some useful features for sending emails. Adds the option to set up SMTP data via constants and functions to test mail delivery.

## Features
- Adds the possibility to set SMTP data via constants
- Adds the command ``wp maillon mail_test`` to send a test mail
- Changes the sender name of mails. The website name is used instead of the generic "WordPress". Alternatively, it can be changed via the constant ``MAIL_FROM_NAME``
- The sender address can be changed via the ``MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS`` constant


## What's the story behind the name?
The name is a combination of the word **Mail** and **Mellon**, Elvish for *Friend*.
The plugin is intended to be your friend and helper in the confusion of mail configuration
